Abstract
------
The establishment of various molecular, physiological, and genetic markers for cellular senescence and aging-associated conditions has progressed the aging study. To identify such markers, a combination of optical, proteomic-, and sequencing-based tools is primarily used, often accompanying extrinsic labels. Yet, the tools for clinical detection at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels are still lacking which profoundly hinders advancements in the specific detection and timely prevention of aging-related diseases and pathologies. Raman spectroscopy, with its capability for rapid, label-free, and non-invasive analysis of molecular compositions and alterations in aging cells and tissues, holds considerable promise for in vivo applications. In this review, we present recent advancements in the application of Raman spectroscopy to the study of aging in cells and tissues. We explore the use of Raman spectroscopy and related techniques for detecting cellular aging and senescence, focusing on the molecular alterations that accompany these processes. Subsequently, we provide a review of the application of Raman spectroscopy in identifying aging-related changes in various molecules within tissues and organs.
