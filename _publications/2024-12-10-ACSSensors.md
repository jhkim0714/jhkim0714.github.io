Abstract
------
Raman spectroscopy has revolutionized the field of chemical biology by providing detailed chemical and compositional information with minimal sample preparation. Despite its advantages, the technique suffers from low throughput due to the weak Raman effect, necessitating long acquisition times and expensive equipment. This limitation is particularly acute in time-sensitive applications like bioprocess monitoring and dynamic studies. Compressive sensing offers a promising solution by reducing the burden on measurement hardware, lowering costs, and decreasing measurement times. It allows for the collection of sparse data, which can be computationally reconstructed later. This paper explores the practical application of compressive sensing in spontaneous Raman spectroscopy across various biological samples. We demonstrate its benefits in scenarios requiring portable hardware, rapid acquisition, and minimal storage, such as skin hydration prediction and cellular studies involving drug molecules. Our findings highlight the potential of compressive sensing to overcome traditional limitations of Raman spectroscopy, paving the way for broader adoption in biological research and clinical diagnostics.
